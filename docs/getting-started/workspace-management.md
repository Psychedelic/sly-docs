## SLY - Workspace Management

Through SLY, you can create projects for developing on the Internet Computer, starting both from scratch or using **SLY's predefined templates** that will help you get started with basic use-cases (e.g. a standard token contract canister).

SLY allows you to easily create a new project using `sly new <NAME>`.

We also have different templates that you can use, just use `sly new -h` to get more
information about each template.
