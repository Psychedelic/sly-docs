# SLY - Workspace Management

## SLY - Workspace Management

Through SLY, you can create projects for developing on the Internet Computer, starting both from scratch or using **SLY's predefined templates** that will help you get started with basic use-cases (e.g. a standard token contract canister).

## Starting a new Project

SLY allows you to easily create a new project using 

```
sly new <NAME>
```


## Using SLY's Templates
We also have different templates that you can use, just use `sly new -h` to get more information about each template. 

> At the moment, we only have the Rust backend template utilized in the canister. More templates will be added soon!
